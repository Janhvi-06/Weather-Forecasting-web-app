# Weather-Forecasting-web-app

📌 Overview :
This is a Weather Forecasting Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to search for real-time weather updates of any city in the world by fetching data from an external weather API.
The project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout, and dynamic data handling through JavaScript.


💡 _Features_ :
1. Search weather information by city name
2. Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition
3. Dynamic background or weather icons based on live conditions
4. responsive and mobile-friendly design
5. Uses real-time data from an external API (like OpenWeatherMap API)



🧠 Technologies Used : 
1. Frontend - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
2. API      - 	External Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
3. Tools    - 	VS Code, Git, GitHub



⚙️ How It Works :
1. The user enters the city name all over India in the search bar.
2. The app sends a fetch request to the weather API using JavaScript.
3. The API returns real-time weather data in JSON format.
4. The data is displayed dynamically on the screen.



🧩 API Integration :
This project uses a public API such as OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
You can register for a free API key and replace it in your script.js file like this :  const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";



🎯 Purpose of the Project :
This project was developed as part of my internship program to gain hands-on experience with:
1. API integration using JavaScript
2. Front-end design principles
3. GitHub project management
4. Real-world web application deployment

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Weather Forecasting Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **search for real-time weather updates** of any city in the world by fetching data from an **external weather API**.  
The project focuses on a **clean UI design**, **responsive layout**, and **dynamic data handling** through JavaScript.

## 💡 Features
🌍 Search weather information by city name  
🌦️ Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition  
🌡️ Dynamic background or weather icons based on live conditions  
📱 Responsive and mobile-friendly design

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user enters the city name in the search bar.  
2. The app sends a **fetch request** to the weather API using JavaScript.  
3. The API returns **real-time weather data** in JSON format.  
4. The data is **displayed dynamically** on the screen.

## 🧩 API Integration
This project uses a public API such as **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data.  
You can register for a free API key and replace it in your `script.js` file like this:
const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was developed as part of my **internship program** to gain hands-on experience with:  
- API integration using JavaScript  
- Front-end design principles  
- GitHub project management  
- Real-world web application deployment
